BFilt is a multi-platform and open-source C++ bayesian  filtering library. It contains  useful and classical algorithms in state estimation  of hidden markov models. So you can easily construct discrete-disrete (DD) and continuous-discrete (CD) models (linear or nonlinear) for filtering (Kalman, EKF, UKF, particle filters, ...) and simulation methods. Indeed, markovian model simulators can be used for particle filters. Libraries such as BFL and Bayes++ consider only discrete-discrete filtering. With BFilt, you can easily construct your own CD or DD models for filtering. For CD models stochastic discretization methods (Euler, Runge Kutta, Local linearization, Heun) are implemented in simulation and filtering.

LAPACK  and  CPPLAPACK libraries are used for linear algebra operations. For best performances it is recommended to compile yourself the LAPPACK libraries with ATLAS. The  Gnu Scientific Library  (GSL)  achieves random  drawing in  simulators. These  open-source  and multi-platform libraries  must be installed before install BFilt.
